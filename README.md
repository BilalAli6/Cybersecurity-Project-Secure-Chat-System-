# Secure Chat System (Cybersecurity Project)

This project was developed as part of my **Cybersecurity** course, showcasing the implementation of a secure client-server chat system in Python. It ensures confidentiality and data security through encryption techniques.

## ðŸŒŸ Features
- **Registration and Login:**
  - Secure registration using unique usernames and hashed passwords (with random salts for added security).
  - Credentials securely stored in a file.

- **Encrypted Messaging:**
  - **Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange** for secure key generation.
  - Real-time message encryption with **AES-128 CBC Mode**.

- **Security Highlights:**
  - Passwords are salted and hashed to prevent rainbow table attacks.
  - Message confidentiality verified using tools like **Wireshark**.

## ðŸš€ Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Key Concepts:** Cryptography (Diffie-Hellman, AES, SHA-256), File handling.
